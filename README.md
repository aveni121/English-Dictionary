# English-Dictionary
A Python program that acts as an English dictionary that a user can search words from. The program loads a database from a .json file containing a dictionary with the words as keys and the  list of definitions as it’s values.  The program prompts the user to enter the word they are searching for and prints out  the definitions. If the word contains a typo        Ex. “rainn” the program would get the closest match “rain” and prompts the user if that is the word they are searching for. If the user selects yes the definition for rain is printed out.
